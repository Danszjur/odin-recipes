        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p id="Description">
          Gulyás soup (often called “goulash”) is a traditional Hungarian dish,
          famous for its rich flavor and hearty ingredients. Originally prepared
          by herdsmen, this soup combines tender beef, root vegetables,
          potatoes, and the distinctive taste of Hungarian paprika to create a
          warming and satisfying meal. It is typically enjoyed as a main course
          and is perfect for family gatherings or cold days. The balance of
          spices and slow cooking bring out deep, comforting flavors that
          represent the essence of Hungarian cuisine.
